## Authoritative Scope Decisions & Invariants

1. **Backwards Compatibility & Backup Restoration**:
   - Old / pre-Incus backups do NOT restore directly as Incus workers.
   - WorkerRecords without runtime metadata restore as `legacy-docker`, preserving existing behavior.
   - Conversion to `incus-vm` happens ONLY through the explicit Phase 11 migration path. Do not duplicate migration logic inside backup restore.
   - Admin workspaces remain Docker containers and are not migrated.

2. **Worker Identity & VM IP Addressing**:
   - VM IP addresses are runtime state, NOT durable `WorkerRecord` configuration.
   - The `WorkerRecord` is the durable identity.
   - Current addresses are queried authoritatively from Incus and cached in memory. Correctness must tolerate IP changes across restarts/leases.

3. **Phase 9 Managed Networks Scope**:
   - Only preserves existing Agentor Managed Network semantics.
   - Map managed networks to Incus networks/NICs and enforce required IP/MAC anti-spoofing (`security.ipv4_filtering: true`, `security.mac_filtering: true`).
   - Do NOT expand this into a new worker-to-worker isolation or egress-policy subsystem; that remains explicitly out of scope.

4. **Phase 11 Legacy Migration Scope**:
   - Must remain a small, bounded migration mechanism.
   - Flow: Stop the legacy source worker and leave its container and source volumes untouched. Create destination persistent state, copy data, create and validate the Incus VM, and only then commit the runtime switch.
   - On failure: discard/clean incomplete destination resources and restart the untouched legacy source.
   - Use only a small bounded per-worker migration state for crash recovery.
   - Do NOT introduce generic snapshot frameworks, global transaction journals, capacity ledgers, image-proof systems, or other generalized migration infrastructure.

5. **Security & Control-Plane Invariants**:
   - Mutual TLS HTTPS API for Incus with restricted project `agentor` (no unix socket mounted in orchestrator container).
   - Mandatory anti-spoofing on worker NICs (`security.ipv4_filtering: true`, `security.mac_filtering: true`).
   - Ephemeral runtime config passed in `/run/agentor/worker.env` via guest agent file push.
   - Native Docker in VM runs on guest ext4 block volume (`/var/lib/docker`) on dedicated Incus custom block volume.
   - Never fall back to privileged Docker if Incus operations fail.

## Current Status Details

### Phase 3 Summary (Derived Image Pipeline)
- Validated end-to-end on live QEMU/KVM on disposable host `agentor-kata-preflight` (`172.19.0.1:22375`).
- `worker/vm/Dockerfile.vm`: Layered on base worker image with kernel (`linux-image-virtual`), systemd init, bootloader (`grub-efi`), `dbus`, `netplan.io`, `udev`, `agentor-worker.service`, `agentor-docker-storage.service`, and `systemd-networkd`.
- `worker/vm/agentor-docker-storage.sh`: Auto-formats and mounts `/dev/disk/by-id/*incus_docker*` to `/var/lib/docker`.
- `worker/entrypoint.sh`: Sourced `/run/agentor/worker.env` and supports systemd native Docker.
- `scripts/build-incus-worker-image.sh`: Builds VM image, converts via `d2vm --raw`, converts to GPT with ESP partition (`sgdisk -g`), installs UEFI GRUB (`grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --removable`), compresses with `qemu-img convert -c`, and imports into Incus with alias `agentor-worker-vm`.
- Empirical validation: VM launched, booted in ~3 seconds, acquired DHCP IP, code-server (:8443) and noVNC (:6080) responsive, `incus-agent` working, native Docker verified (`docker run --rm busybox echo 'NATIVE DOCKER IN VM WORKS!'`).

### Next Exact Task
- Commit Phase 3 (`feat(incus): build derived worker VM images`).
- Proceed to Phase 4 (Minimal Incus worker create/start in `orchestrator/server/utils/container.ts`).
